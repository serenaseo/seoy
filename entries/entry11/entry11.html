            <p>Dear all,</p>
            <p>My birthday holds a special meaning to me, but more than that, it’s the moments spent together that I truly cherish. I am deeply grateful for every moment shared with those who have been part of my life, and for all the people who will join me in the future. I hope to convey my heartfelt thanks to all of you.</p>

           <p>To those who have guided me along the way, to the friends who’ve been there for me, and to my family who’ve shared precious time with me, I want to say thank you. Because of all of you, I have grown year by year, and it is through this growth that I can reflect on the gratitude I feel. That’s why my birthdays always feel more special with all of you in my life.</p>
